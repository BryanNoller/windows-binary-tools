	qd reg users\.default
	

 svc		a windows or kernel service. <name> is the name of a service.
		On Windows Server 2003 and above, omitting <name> will display
		the permissions for the Service Control Manager, versions 
		prior to Server 2003 will return an error.

	qd svc acpi
	qd svc (only valid on Server 2003 and above)
	

 prn		a printer, <name> identifies an installed printer.

				case sensitive and must be quoted if it 
				contains spaces)

			thread     <name> is a thread id
			job        <name> is a the name of a job

		If [additional] is process or thread, then "token"
		(without quotes) can be	added to retrieve the information
		for the process or thread token.

examples:
	qd kernel process 1428
	qd kernel notify MyAppMutex
	qd kernel notify ShimSharedMemory
	qd kernel thread 3544 token
	qd kernel directory \BaseNamedObjects\FirstWinlogonCheck
	

The <name> value can be prefixed by \\Computer\, where Computer is the
identifer of a remote computer in the local network, to specify that
the object on that computer be queried (except for kernel objects which
must be on the local computer).

examples:
	qd file "\\2003Virtual\\.\pipe\Ctx_WinStation_API_service"
