ACTIVATION

Online connection is necessary for the initial license activation. License is tied to a specific machine upon activation, and can be reactivated online using different host hardware for up to 5 times per license, after which an email-only activation is in effect. Software can function and be upgraded offline, without the need for reactivation unless hardware was changed. License activation is preserved over the host OS reinstalations, if the acompanying original activated license file was backed up and hardware did not change.

We warrant that the software will provide the features and functions generally described in the product specification on our website when you purchased it and in the product documentation.

We have taken reasonable steps to keep the software free of viruses, spyware, "back door" entrances, or any other harmful code. We will not track or collect any information about you, your data, or your use of the software except license activation and as you specifically authorize.

Additionally, if Microsoft changes how a supported Windows version operates, and thus permanently disabling a certain feature of this program, we reserve the right to pivot or remove the affected feature from the program.


LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we disclaim all liability for indirect or consequential damages that arise under this license agreement.


GENERAL PROVISIONS
